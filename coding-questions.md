# Coding Questions

### 1. [Given a sorted array of N elements and an element K. Fine the frequency of element K in the array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-of-occurrence2259/1)
- Discussion on edge cases like
    - if the element K is not present in the array
    - if the array is null or empty

### 2. [Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-path-sum-from-any-node/1)
- Discussion on edge cases like
    - if binary tree is empty or null
    - if all nodes in tree contains negative values only
 
### 3. [Given an array of N elements and an integer X, find 3 elements in the array whose sum is closest to given element X ](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/three-sum-closest/1/#:~:text=Given%20an%20array%20Arr%20of,sum%202%20in%20the%20array.)
- Discussion on edge cases like
    - if input array is empty or null
    - if input array contains less than 3 numbers or no such triplest exists in the array
    - if there are multiple triplets in the array. (print any one triplet)

    
### 4. String manipulation question [LC - Easy/Medium]. Was asked a follow up question which was to basically add this function to the Function prototype chain.

### 5. Flatten Array for example Input: [[1,2],[[3,4]],[5]] Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

### 6.  Don't quite remember the exact question but it was related to DOM tree traversal.

### 7. Given a string, reverse only the alphabets keeping rest of the character at the same place

### 8. Find all pairs in an array where sum is equal to a certain number(You can create a JS Object and then directly look for sum-num in Object)

### 9. DP based question(You have to use memoization to solve this)

### 10. [Rotten Tomato](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/)

### 11. [Missing Number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-missing-number/)

### 12. [Merge K sorted arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays/)

### 13. [Binary Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/)

### 14. [Valid Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-mountain-array/)
