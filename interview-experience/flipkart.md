## Round 1 : Machine Coding

# Machine Coding Questions

## 4. Question - Bowling Alley 

### Write machine code for a single-lane bowling alley system. 

One bowling game will be played by multiple players on a single lane.     
During the game, players and their scores will be maintained and shown by the system and the winner will be declared at the end of the game.          
                 
Some rules about bowling: 
- The Game of bowling consists of 5 Rounds. 
- Each round consists of alternate plays (one by each player), and each player will have two chances to drop all the “pins” 
- The score for a round is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for **strikes** and **spares**. 
- A **strike** is when the player knocks down all ten pins on the first try. If there is a strike the player gets 10 bonus points. 
- A **spare** is when the player knocks down all ten pins in two tries. If there is spare the player gets 5 bonus points. 
- In the final round, a player who rolls a **spare** or a **strike** is allowed to roll extra 2 balls(not rounds) to complete the round. This allows for a potential of 7 strikes (5+2) in a single game. 
- **Strike** is denoted by **‘x’** and **spare** is denoted by ‘/’. All other pin drop count can be denoted by 0 - 9 (for ex: 5, if five pins were dropped in a round) 
- After the final round, display the Player list in ranked order on the basis of score.          

### Bonus Point: (Only Attempt If Time Permits) 

**Changing Bonus Rule:** Bonus points are awarded, depending on what is scored in the next 2 balls (for a strike) or next 1 ball (for a spare). 

_Input:_
- No. of players  
- Score Input can be taken from fileInput or console. 

_Output:_ 
- Current position of the running games (Scoreboard) and after the final round, display players in ranked order on the basis of score.    

_Example:_ 

- Below example is for 3 Rounds 
```
Input:
Number of players: 2 

Round 1:         
Enter Score for Player1 - Chance1: 8

Player1 Score Chance1 - 10pins                    
Player1 Score Chance2 - 8pins Chance3 - 2pin (Extra chance as all pins were dropped in last round)              ********************************************************* 
Scoreboard:          
P1: {8,/}, {2,7}, {X,}, {8,/} -> 59 (24+(10+10)+(10+5)) P2: {X, }, {6, /}, {} -> 35

```


**Final Output:** 
P1 - 59 points (winner)       
P2 - 42 points     

_Example for bonus question:_ 
```
Strike: 
    Round 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike) 
    Round 2, ball 1: 3 pins 
    Round 2, ball 2: 6 pins 
    The total score from these throws is: 
    Round one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19 
    Round two: 3 + 6 = 9 
    TOTAL = 28 

Spare: 
    Round 1, ball 1: 7 pins 
    Round 1, ball 2: 3 pins (spare) 
    Round 2, ball 1: 4 pins 
    Round 2, ball 2: 2 pins 

The total score from these throws is: 
    Round one: 7 + 3 + 4 (bonus) = 14 
    Round two: 4 + 2 = 6
    TOTAL = 20

## 2. Question - Two Forms as Filters

### Create a frontend system having below features [Flipkart 2021 - UI Developer]

## Left side of UI

- A small form containing radio buttons, two text boxes and submit button.
- The radio buttons needs to be implemented in form of small circles having specific size.
- The two text boxes are labelled as **Title** and **Subtitle**
- The background of radio buttons needs to be colored. The color needs to be randomly generated by calling an API that was given to me.
- The purpose of the form is to act as a filter. It could take input in different form of combinations such as by selecting color, color + inputting title, color + subtitle, color + title + subtitle. 
- Based on the input given, the final output will be filtered accordingly.
- The final output is nothing but a list of rectangular boxes having specific color as background and containing title or subtitle based on filter selected.
- Say, if you choose blue color, then all those rectangles having blue color will be displayed.
- Say, if you choose green color and input title as "Title1" then all the rectangles having color green and title "Title1" will be displayed.
- Say, if you choose any filter which doesn't match with any rectangles then no rectangles will be displayed.

## Right side of UI

- The left and right side of UI is to be separated by a thick black line.
- The features for the right side are as below:
- Another form needs to be implemented containing 2 text boxes, several radio buttons whose background colors is to be fetched by calling the API given to me and a submit button.
- Again the 2 text boxes are labelled as **Title** and **Subtitle**
- Based on the type of input given, a corresponding rectangle will get generated to the left hand side of the UI.
- Say, if you choose red color and give title as **"Hello"** then a rectangle with red background color gets generated with the title **"Hello"**

## Round 2 : Coding Round

[interview questions](https://www.ambitionbox.com/interviews/flipkart-interview-questions/front-end-developer)

### 1. [Given a sorted array of N elements and an element K. Fine the frequency of element K in the array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-of-occurrence2259/1)
- Discussion on edge cases like
    - if the element K is not present in the array
    - if the array is null or empty

### 2. [Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-path-sum-from-any-node/1)
- Discussion on edge cases like
    - if binary tree is empty or null
    - if all nodes in tree contains negative values only
 
### 3. [Given an array of N elements and an integer X, find 3 elements in the array whose sum is closest to given element X ](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/three-sum-closest/1/#:~:text=Given%20an%20array%20Arr%20of,sum%202%20in%20the%20array.)
- Discussion on edge cases like
    - if input array is empty or null
    - if input array contains less than 3 numbers or no such triplest exists in the array
    - if there are multiple triplets in the array. (print any one triplet)

### 4. String manipulation question [LC - Easy/Medium]. Was asked a follow up question which was to basically add this function to the Function prototype chain.

### 5. Flatten Array for example Input: [[1,2],[[3,4]],[5]] Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

### 6.  Don't quite remember the exact question but it was related to DOM tree traversal.

### 7. Given a string, reverse only the alphabets keeping rest of the character at the same place

### 8. Find all pairs in an array where sum is equal to a certain number(You can create a JS Object and then directly look for sum-num in Object)

### 9. DP based question(You have to use memoization to solve this)

### 10. [Rotten Tomato](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/)

### 11. [Missing Number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-missing-number/)

### 12. [Merge K sorted arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays/)

### 13. [Binary Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/)
