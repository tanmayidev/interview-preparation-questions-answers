• Find Duplicate Words
o For example, given 'The dog is the best', returns ["the"].
o Likewise, given 'Happy thanksgiving, I am so full', you would return an empty
array. This is because there are no duplicates in the string.
• Most Strongly Connected
o You're given the following multi-dimensional array matrix:
const matrix = [
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
];
o Could you find the largest concentration of connected 1s in the matrix?
o Write MostConnectedOnes(matrix: array[]) class or method that uncovers this.
